# Churn-Prediction

In this Project I use Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, Keras etc.

Developed a churn prediction model using an artificial neural network (ANN) to classify customers as likely to churn or stay.

Preprocessed the dataset by splitting it into training (8,000 samples) and testing (2,000 samples) sets.

Designed a fully connected ANN with 12 input nodes, one hidden layer with 6 nodes, and a single-node output layer using sigmoid activation.

Achieved an accuracy of 86.82% after training the model for 100 epochs, utilizing ReLU for hidden layers and Adam optimizer for efficient training.

Enhanced the prediction process for customer retention strategies in business applications.
